## 🚀 About the Project

RankerUp (version 3) was built with one clear goal:
accelerate algorithm learning in C, with a strong focus on backtracking, to prepare for the Rank 3 exam at 42.

More than just a collection of exercises, RankerUp is designed as an interactive challenge platform that guides students step by step, training them to think algorithmically while gaining hands-on experience.

# 🌟 What makes it unique? Every exercise doesn’t just test your solution — it teaches you to structure your thinking and build confidence for the real exam.

## 🛠️ Technical Challenges I Solved

Building RankerUp required solving complex engineering problems, such as:

- Scalable challenge structure
Designed a flexible architecture to support multiple difficulty levels and algorithms, making it easy to expand and maintain in future versions.

- Optimized backtracking algorithms
Instead of brute force, I implemented intelligent pruning techniques to reduce execution time in problems like N-Queens.

- Interactive feedback system
Built a test runner that not only validates results but also provides guidance on common mistakes, helping learners improve faster.

## ⚡ Key Features

✔️ Progressive challenges: from basics to advanced backtracking problems.
✔️ Exercises that simulate real Rank 3 exam questions.
✔️ Clear explanations and error insights.
✔️ Written in pure, optimized C.
✔️ Fully open-source and extendable.

## 🎨 Innovation & Creativity

RankerUp is not just another exercise list.
It blends:

Gamified learning → progress feels rewarding and motivating.

Mastery learning approach → you only move forward once you’ve mastered each concept.

Modular architecture → adding new challenges is simple and efficient.

Real exam simulation → training under pressure, just like at 42.

This makes studying a practical, engaging, and impactful experience.

## 🧩 Example Challenge

🔹 N-Queens Problem:

Place N queens on an NxN chessboard so that none of them attack each other.

RankerUp teaches how to solve it using backtracking + pruning techniques, instead of brute force attempts.
